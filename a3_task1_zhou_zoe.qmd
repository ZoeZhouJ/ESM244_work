### About

The goal of this analysis is to explore patterns in water chemistry across sites in the Santa Barbara Coastal drainage area using **agglomerative hierarchical clustering**. This method groups sites based on their similarities by starting with each site as its own cluster and merging the most similar clusters step by step. Two approaches will be applied: **complete linkage**, which merges clusters based on the largest distance between their points, creating compact groups, and **single linkage**, which uses the smallest distance between points, often forming chain-like clusters. The resulting dendrograms will visually represent the clustering structure, helping to identify groupings among the sites based on their water chemistry profiles. 

### Data

The dataset used for this analysis is **Stream chemistry in the Santa Barbara Coastal drainage area**, which contains water chemistry data collected from various sites in the Santa Barbara Coastal region. The dataset has been maintained since 2000 and provides detailed chemical measurements for streams in the area. The data is sourced from the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program and was created by John Melack. The dataset is available through the Environmental Data Initiative and can be cited as follows:

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand summary table</summary>

```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/stream_chemistry.csv", na = "-999")
#head(df)
#summary(df)
skim(df)
```
</details>

### Step 2: Data Wrangling 

Note that this dataset contains a lot of NAs. Identify columns with more than 50% missing values and drop them. Use `summary()` to inspect the dataset and decide how to handle the remaining missing values (e.g., listwise deletion or summarizing with `na.rm = TRUE`).

```{r}
# drop columns with more than 50% Na values
water <- df[, colMeans(is.na(df)) <= 0.5]
skim(water)
```
In the above process, `TPC_uM`, `TPN_uM`, `TPP_uM`, and `TSS_mg_per_L` columns were droped due to having NAs higher than the 50% threshold.

In the next step, I chose to use summarizing with `na.rm = TRUE` instead of listwise deletion because it retains rows with missing data but excludes missing values during calculations, preserving more data overall. This approach is particularly useful when missing values are scattered across variables, ensuring that we maximize the use of available data for each site.

Group the data by site and calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean) for each variable. Use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions for this step. 
```{r}
# summarize mean variable by sites
by_site <- water %>% 
  group_by(site_code) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric),
                   ~mean(., na.rm=TRUE))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

### Step 3: Compute Euclidean Distance
Use the dist() function to calculate the Euclidean distance matrix for the summarized data.

```{r}
# scale the numeric data
by_site_scaled <- by_site %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  scale()

# Add site code back to scaled data
rownames(by_site_scaled) <- by_site$site_code
rownames(by_site) <- by_site$site_code
# Compute dissimilarity values (Euclidean distance):
euc_distance_scaled <- stats::dist(by_site_scaled, method = "euclidean")
euc_distance <- stats::dist(by_site, method="euclidean")
#euc_distance
```

### Step 4: Perform Hierarchical Clustering with Complete Linkage Method
Use the hclust() function to perform clustering with the complete linkage method. Optionally, repeat with the single linkage method for comparison.
```{r}
# Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage
hc_complete_scaled <- hclust(euc_distance_scaled, method="complete")
hc_complete <- hclust(euc_distance, method="complete")
```
Use the plot() function to create a dendrogram. Add a title and labels for clarity.
```{r}
p_complete <- ggdendrogram(hc_complete, rotate=TRUE)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title="Dendrogram of Hierarchical Clustering (complete linkage)",
       x = "Site")
#p_complete

p_complete_scaled <- ggdendrogram(hc_complete_scaled, rotate=TRUE)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title="Dendrogram of Hierarchical Clustering (complete linkage)",
       x = "Site")
p_complete + p_complete_scaled
```
**Questions**: should I have scaled? 

### Step 5: Perform Hierarchical Clustering with Single Linkage Method
Repeat with the single linkage method for comparison.
```{r}
hc_single <- hclust(euc_distance_scaled, method="single") 
```
Use the `dendextend` package to create a tanglegram that compares the dendrograms from complete and single linkage.
```{r}
p_single<-ggdendrogram(hc_single, 
             rotate = TRUE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Dendrogram of Hierarchical Clustering (single linkage)",
       x = "Country")
#p_single


```

### Step 6: Compare Linkage Methods

```{r}
# convert hclust result for dendrograms
dend_complete <- as.dendrogram(hc_complete_scaled)
dend_single <- as.dendrogram(hc_single)
# plot tanglegram
tanglegram(dend_complete,
           dend_single,
           main="Tanglegram: Complete vs Single Linkage",
           color_lines = c("darksalmon", "lightblue"),
           lwd = 1)
```
