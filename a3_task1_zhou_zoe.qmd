### About

The goal of this analysis is to explore patterns in water chemistry across sites in the Santa Barbara Coastal drainage area using **agglomerative hierarchical clustering**. This method groups sites based on their similarities by starting with each site as its own cluster and merging the most similar clusters step by step. Two approaches will be applied: **complete linkage**, which merges clusters based on the largest distance between their points, creating compact groups, and **single linkage**, which uses the smallest distance between points, often forming chain-like clusters. The resulting dendrograms will visually represent the clustering structure, helping to identify groupings among the sites based on their water chemistry profiles. 

### Data

The dataset used for this analysis is **Stream chemistry in the Santa Barbara Coastal drainage area**, which contains water chemistry data collected from various sites in the Santa Barbara Coastal region. The dataset has been maintained since 2000 and provides detailed chemical measurements for streams in the area. The data is sourced from the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER) program and was created by John Melack. The dataset is available through the Environmental Data Initiative and can be cited as follows:

Load the dataset and convert -999 values to NA as specified in the dataset documentation. Provide data summary after preliminary date exploration.

<details>
<summary>Click here to expand summary table</summary>

```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/stream_chemistry.csv", na = "-999")
#head(df)
#summary(df)
skim(df)
```
</details>

### 2. Data Wrangling 

Note that this dataset contains a lot of NAs. Identify columns with more than 50% missing values and drop them. Use `summary()` to inspect the dataset and decide how to handle the remaining missing values (e.g., listwise deletion or summarizing with `na.rm = TRUE`).

```{r}
# drop columns with more than 50% Na values
water <- df[, colMeans(is.na(df)) <= 0.5]
#skim(water)
```

In the above process, `TPC_uM`, `TPN_uM`, `TPP_uM`, and `TSS_mg_per_L` columns were droped due to having NAs higher than the 50% threshold.

In the next step, I chose to use summarizing with `na.rm = TRUE` instead of listwise deletion because it retains rows with missing data but excludes missing values during calculations, preserving more data overall. This approach is particularly useful when missing values are scattered across variables, ensuring that we maximize the use of available data for each site.

Group the data by site and calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean) for each variable. Use the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions for this step. 
```{r}
# summarize mean variable by sites
by_site <- water %>% 
  group_by(site_code) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric),
                   ~mean(., na.rm=TRUE))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

### 3. Compute Euclidean Distance
Use the `dist()` function to calculate the Euclidean distance matrix for the summarized data.

```{r}
# scale the numeric data
by_site_scaled <- by_site %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% 
  scale() %>% 
  as.data.frame()

# Add site code back to scaled data
rownames(by_site_scaled) <- by_site$site_code

# Compute dissimilarity values (Euclidean distance):
euc_distance_scaled <- stats::dist(by_site_scaled, method = "euclidean")

# euc_distance_scaled
```

### 4. Complete Linkage Clustering
Use the `hclust()` function to perform clustering with the complete linkage method. Optionally, repeat with the single linkage method for comparison.
```{r}
# Hierarchical clustering with complete linkage
hc_complete_scaled <- hclust(euc_distance_scaled, method="complete")

```
Use the `plot()` function to create a dendrogram. Add a title and labels for clarity.
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 1: Dendrogram of Complete Linkage Clustering"
dend_complete <- as.dendrogram(hc_complete_scaled)
dend_complete %>% 
  set("branches_k_color", k=10) %>% 
  plot(main="Dendrogram of Complete Linkage Clustering",
       xlab="Site IDs"
      )

```

### 5. Single Linkage Clustering
Repeat with the single linkage method for comparison. 
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 2: Dendrogram of Single Linkage Clustering"
hc_single <- hclust(euc_distance_scaled, method="single") 

# convert hclust result for dendrograms
dend_single <- as.dendrogram(hc_single)

# Plot single linkage dendrogram
dend_single %>% 
  set("branches_k_color", k=13) %>% 
  plot(main="Dendrogram of Single Linkage Clustering",
       xlab="Site IDs"
      )
```


### 6. Compare Linkage Methods
Use the `dendextend` package to create a tanglegram that compares the dendrograms from complete and single linkage. A tanglegram plot gives two dendrogram, one facing the other, and having their labels connected by lines.

The methods differ in respect to how they define proximity between any two clusters at every step. In single linkage, the proximity between two clusters is determined by the distance between their two closest observations. In contrast, in complete linkage, the proximity between two clusters is measured by the maximum distance between any two points in the clusters.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 3: Tanglegram of Two Clustering Method"
# plot tanglegram and improve layout with untangle function
untangle(dend_complete, dend_single, method = "step1side") %>% 
  tanglegram(
             main_left ="Complete Linkage",
             main_right = "Single Linkage",
             common_subtrees_color_lines = TRUE,
             common_subtrees_color_branches=TRUE,
             highlight_distinct_edges = TRUE,
             lwd = 1) 

# makes global comparison of two dendrograms trees
all.equal(dend_complete, dend_single)
```


Prune trees for better visualization
```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Figure 4: Clustering of Sites by Nitrogen Concentration"
# Prepare df for plotting
by_site_scaled <- by_site_scaled %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "site_code")

# Prune the dendrogram to show only top 5 clusters
hc_cut <- cutree(hc_complete_scaled, k=5)

# Add cluster number to the data
by_site_clustered <- by_site_scaled %>% 
  mutate(cluster = hc_cut)

# Plot histogram
ggplot(by_site_clustered, aes(x = reorder(site_code, cluster), y = tdn_uM, fill = factor(cluster)))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x="Site IDs", y="Total dissolved nitrogen (uM/L)", fill="Cluster")
```

### Conclusion
The dendrograms from Figure 1 and 2 reveal distinct clusters of sites based on water chemistry. SP02, MC00, and AB00 merge at a low height, indicating highly similar water chemistry, likely due to shared environmental conditions or pollution sources. Similarly, RS02 and HO00 merge at a low height, confirming their high similarity. ON02 clusters with this group, showing significant similarities in water chemistry.

In contrast, BC02 and DV01 are the last sites to merge, indicating their water chemistry is distinctly different from the others. This suggests unique environmental factors or pollution sources at these sites. The dendrogramâs consistent groupings, regardless of the linkage method. 

The bar chart in Figure 4 visually represents nitrogen levels across various sites, offering a quantitative measure of water chemistry differences that align with the dendrogramâs clustering patterns. Sites in Cluster 1 (Red) exhibit intermediate nitrogen levels, reflecting their moderate similarity in water chemistry. In contrast, Cluster 2 (Green), which includes only BC02, shows extremely high nitrogen concentrations, explaining its distinct grouping in the dendrogram.
